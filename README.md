# Bond-Slip Model for Reinforced Concrete Structures

This repository contains code implementations and resources related to the "Bond-Slip Model for Detailed Finite-Element Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Structures" paper by [author(s)](https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0001070).

## Overview

The bond-slip model is a crucial aspect of reinforced concrete (RC) structural analysis, determining the interaction between concrete and reinforcing bars. This repository provides code for implementing the bond-slip model, enabling detailed finite-element analysis of RC structures.

## Features

- **Implementation**: Python code implementing the bond-slip model as described in the paper.
- **Parameterization**: Easily adjustable parameters such as rebar diameter, concrete strength, and critical slip values.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of bond stress and slip curves.
- **Data Export**: Export calculated bond stress and slip data to CSV format for further analysis.
